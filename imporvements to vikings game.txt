- create other kinds of soldiers, as in: cabalry, archers, berserkersâ€¦
- define a function that creates those soldiers randomly and store them in the army list
- add one argument to the war that's distances / field
- add characteristics to the soldier units such as: range, movement speed, attack speed. crit chance...
- improved the army creator to have bigger size and limited special units for each armyS


for the field / distances / movement funcitonalities
- We have to set a position stat for each unit in  the army
- we have to set on the can attack function, that if the unit is in the range of the attack of each unit, they can attack, otherwise, False
- Somehow, we have to add too, that the units move at different speeds in the field, and that there are some that don't have to move, like the archers
